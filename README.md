## Terragrunt

In order to run terragrunt commands,
setup my AWS profile and DigitalOcean token first:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=pauvilella
export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=<...>
```

### Notes

The only active cloud I have is AWS for testing and trying out things.

I am not currently using Digital Ocean, I only have the project created
(so only the `./do/projects/` folder is applied).
